# ✈️Flight Reservation System (Java)
The Flight Reservation System is a menu-driven Java console application designed to simulate the basic operations of an airline booking system. The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and effective use of the Java Collections Framework.

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Flight Reservation System** is a menu-driven Java console application that simulates the basic functionalities of an airline booking system. It allows users to view flight details, search flights, sort flights by price, and book flights interactively.

This project is designed to demonstrate **core Java programming concepts**, including object-oriented programming (OOP), collections, sorting, searching, and user input handling. It is suitable for academic purposes, lab assignments, and beginners learning Java.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To design a simple flight booking system using Java
- To understand and implement OOP concepts such as classes and objects
- To use the Java Collections Framework (`ArrayList`)
- To implement searching and sorting techniques
- To develop a menu-driven console application

---

## 🔧 Features
- View all available flights
- Sort flights by ticket price
- Search flights by destination
- Search flights by flight number
- Book flights with booking status validation
- Display booking status (Available / Booked)
- User-friendly menu-driven interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Collections Framework
- Console-based input/output
